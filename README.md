# segment-anything-2-onnx-models
Pre-exported ONNX models for SAM2 (Segment Anything 2) in various sizes and resolutions.

本来就不懂python，我是写WPF程序需要用到SAM，搞了2天终于弄好了，之前找了好几个都没有转换ONNX成功，我都打算放弃了。。。
现在已经成功导出了SAM2的图像和视频的ONNX模型文件，
唉，为了让不懂的人能够直接拿到ONNX，都已经分类好了，谁用得着的话就拿走吧，图像的测试过，视频的应该也没啥问题。

I don't know Python at all. I needed to use SAM for my WPF application, and it took me two days to finally get it working. 
I tried several methods before, but none of them converted to ONNX successfully, and I was about to give up...
Now I've successfully exported the SAM2 image and video ONNX model files.
Sigh, to make it easier for people who don't know anything to get ONNX directly, I've categorized everything. 
Anyone who needs it can take it. The image files have been tested, and the video files should be fine too.
